# 5. API Design

## 6. High-Level Architecture

The system follows a microservices architecture with the following components:

### Frontend Layer

- Web Application (React/Vue.js): Responsive web interface
- Mobile Apps (React Native/Flutter): iOS and Android applications
- CDN: Content delivery network for static assets

### API Gateway Layer

- API Gateway: Route requests, authentication, rate limiting, and load balancing
- Load Balancer: Distribute traffic across service instances

### Microservices Layer

- User Service: Handle user registration, authentication, and profile management
- Movie Service: Manage movie data, metadata, and basic operations
- Search Service: Elasticsearch-based search functionality
- Review Service: Handle ratings, reviews, and user-generated content
- Recommendation Service: Generate personalized movie recommendations
- Notification Service: Push notifications and alerts
- Admin Service: Administrative functions and content management

### Data Layer

- Primary Database (PostgreSQL): User data, movies, reviews (strong consistency)
- Search Database (Elasticsearch): Optimized for movie search and discovery
- Cache Layer (Redis): Session data, frequently accessed content, search results
- Message Queue (Apache Kafka): Asynchronous processing and event-driven communication
- File Storage (AWS S3): Movie posters, trailers, profile pictures

### External Services

- Movie Data APIs: TMDB, IMDB APIs for comprehensive movie information
- Push Notification Service: Firebase/APNs for mobile notifications
- Email Service: SendGrid for email notifications
- Monitoring & Analytics: Application performance monitoring and user analytics

## 7. Deep Dives

### 7.1 Database Scalability

**Challenge**: Handling millions of movies and users with complex relationships and high read/write loads.

**Solutions**:

- **Database Sharding**: Shard user data by user_id hash, movie data by movie_id
- **Read Replicas**: Multiple read replicas for movie data (heavily read-oriented)
- **Caching Strategy**:
  - Redis for user sessions and frequently accessed movie details
  - Application-level caching for recommendation results (TTL: 1 hour)
- **Database Choice**: PostgreSQL for ACID compliance, with specialized databases for specific use cases

### 7.2 Search & Discovery Performance

**Challenge**: Sub-100ms search response time across millions of movies with complex filtering.

**Solutions**:

- **Elasticsearch Cluster**: Dedicated search infrastructure with multiple nodes
- **Index Optimization**:
  - Separate indices for movies, actors, and aggregate data
  - Custom analyzers for movie titles and descriptions
- **Search Result Caching**: Cache popular search queries in Redis (TTL: 30 minutes)
- **Auto-complete**: Precomputed suggestions stored in cache for instant response

### 7.3 Recommendation System

**Challenge**: Real-time personalized recommendations for millions of users.

**Solutions**:

- **Hybrid Approach**: Combine collaborative filtering, content-based, and popularity-based algorithms
- **Precomputation**:
  - Batch processing (daily) for collaborative filtering models
  - Real-time updates for content-based recommendations
- **Machine Learning Pipeline**:
  - Spark/MLlib for processing large-scale user behavior data
  - Feature store for user preferences and movie characteristics
- **A/B Testing Framework**: Experiment with different recommendation algorithms

### 7.4 Notification System

**Challenge**: Timely delivery of relevant notifications without overwhelming users.

**Solutions**:

- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Kafka for decoupling notification triggers
- **Smart Batching**: Group similar notifications to reduce noise
- **Delivery Optimization**:
  - Push notifications for mobile (Firebase)
  - Email for digest summaries
  - In-app notifications for immediate feedback
- **Preference Management**: User-configurable notification settings

### 7.5 Content Delivery & Media Handling

**Challenge**: Fast delivery of movie posters, trailers, and other media content globally.

**Solutions**:

- **CDN Strategy**: Multi-tier CDN with edge locations worldwide
- **Image Optimization**:
  - Multiple resolutions for different screen sizes
  - WebP/AVIF format support for modern browsers
- **Video Streaming**: Adaptive bitrate streaming for trailers
- **Lazy Loading**: Progressive loading of images and content

### 7.6 Data Consistency & Synchronization

**Challenge**: Maintaining consistency between different data stores and handling eventual consistency.

**Solutions**:

- **Event Sourcing**: Track all user actions as events for audit and recovery
- **CQRS Pattern**: Separate read/write models for optimized performance
- **Saga Pattern**: Manage distributed transactions across microservices
- **Conflict Resolution**: Last-write-wins for user preferences, append-only for reviews

## Implementation

The implementation focuses on core features:

### Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Redis for caching

- **API Documentation**: Swagger/OpenAPI

### Key Features Implementation
